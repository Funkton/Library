EAGLE MISC
- Note: While using ROUTE, tab is an open modifier key. Let's put it to good use.

SUGGESTIONS:

	- ACTIVE ALIGN: Automatic alignment snapping to grid and other elements. Something like Cycling 74's MAX visual programming environment. One of the best user interfaces I've ever used. https://youtu.be/XIAkdjisbfc

	- NEW: Using MOVE, ctrl click can arc a line and move rectangle ends. Suggest Shift+click changes width by moving up or down to grow and shrink. For rectangles it could be a resize center aligned.

	- NEW: GRID: AUTO WIDTH feature to link width to grid size.
		- Steps per grid size. ex: grid = 1mm, steps = 10 , width increment = 1/10 = 0.1mm. Percentage or step input.
		- NEW: using ROUTE, Shift + mousewheel to change width by step increment. Increase/decrease width by holding shift and scrolling. Option to use width menu or AUTO WIDTH step.
	- NEW: GRID: orthogonal grid (rotate grid by 45). Snaps to grid, plus the center point between them.
		
	- NEW: Drawing: Mouse axis lock. Hold shift, then mouse only moves on axis. Start drawing a direction and hold to lock mouse direction. Add diagonal snap to orthogonal axis (45° increments).
	- NEW: Transpose tool (row to column)
	- Add way to remove joints in routes like deleting part of polygons.
	- SMASH: Split into smash text and smash device. Silkscreen and other parts would then be editable.

	- ROUTING: VIA: Suggest shift is momentary via on end. Down to have it at cursor, up regular routing.
	- PROPERTIES: 
		Length: Enable user input. ALIGN buttons, left/center/right. Allows you to enter a length and have it calculate coordinates based on align.
	- TOUCHSCREEN: Add functions to modernize for touch input.
	- ACTIVE RATSNEST: When rip is used on a series of lines, runs automatic ratsnest on line as it goes. Like using ripup on airwires, snapping them to the nearest point.
		ACTIVE AIRWIRE: Snaps airwire to current route or as ripup is used. Airwire rubberbands like when moving element.

	- VIAS: Hide blind vias if layer is not visible.
	- Set tool default layers. (Measures when selecting dimension, tNames when selecting text) Set from eagle.scr?
	- Enable ASSIGN for punctuation. Currently only a-z, 0-9, F1-F12, and backspace. Very limiting.
	- Hide tools that error when selecting.
		BOARD:	Signal - Can't backannotate
			Delete - Suppress backannotate error, just do nothing instead.
	- Smart Drag / Angle Lock. Trace keeps angle while moving endpoint of 45° trace. This would be more useful to me than the entirety of the follow-me router.
	- Add official Teardrop.
	- Add Layer Stack ULP, like Drillegend that takes into account the thickness settings in DRC. (show Layer-Stack library part as example)
		Add Layer stack image export from DRC layers menu.
	- DRC: Make setting up blind/buried vias easier.
	- DRC: Enable adding rigid-flex options to layer stack.
	- DRC: Ignore all errors created by routes inside of pad. Pads are closer together on package than clearance of net class, throws a ton of errors for routing into a part.
	- NET CLASSES: Independent clearance settings for routes, pads, vias, rectangle. 
	- Add TRUELEY global attributes, or at least rename them to board and schematic attributes.
	- EDIT menu: Remove the tool commands and move them to 'TOOLS' Duh.
	- Move User interface elements from 'SET -> MISC' to User Interface. (display options of vias, signals, etc)
	- MENU: Change 'Set...' To 'Settings'. Musch easier for a new comer to understand.
	- Import / Export shortcuts.
	- SETTINGS: Move the lonely 1 DRC item to MISC. Or add additional settings, such as what kind of warnings to suppress.
	- UI: Enable the ability to customize icon locations. Similar to Firefox's. Right click on toolbars, 'Customize'. Drag and drop and remove.
	- UI: Remove bottom unused status bar. Only Icon is a green lightning bolt. Move to upper right.
	- UI: Allow command buttons toolbar to snap to bottom and top.
	- UI: Add HTML (WYSIWYG) editor controls to description editor. List what tags are supported.
	- VARIANTS: When part is not populated, leave silkscreen on board. I want variant to only be reflected in schematic. 
	- VARIANTS: Allow option to select 'populated' from properties dialog.
	- FEATURE: Add ability to use up and down arrows to change width at set increments. WIDTH_MENU has them, just need to be able to navigate them with arrows.
	- FORUM REQUEST: Development Section - Currently in progress bugs or features.
	- FORUM REQUEST: Feature section, with vote system to see what feature is most important to users. (Altium has this)
	- CAM Processor: Allow changing section order. Currently have to modify .cam in text to reorder them.
	REPORTED - SCHEMATIC FEATURE: Independent controls for 'Group command default on'(group auto on in sch, but not brd). https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/eagle-forum/suggestion-separate-settings-for-group-default-on/td-p/6942933
	- SCHEMATIC FEATURE: Stop treating switching sheets as a command that deactivates tools, or at least restore tool or operation after switching.
	- SCHEMATIC FEATURE: Add lock option like brd version.
	- DRC FEATURE: Add separate manufacturing limits design rules (separate clearance error checking, what it should pour vs how close it can be manufactured. DFM Check.
	- ATTRIBUTES: List of all parts' attributes, bulk edit. Allow movement with attributes dialog open, with option of clicking other components. 
	- FEATURE ULP: Stitch ulp to fill empty areas with vias, without colliding. (follow drc clearances)
	- ROTATE: When click and rotate, snap to angle step. Currently roatates to 3+ digits.
	- SHOW: Add option for auto highlight when hovering over tracks (Altium has this)
	- DISPLAY: Hide tracks. Able to see pads only.
	- LIBRARY:
		- Add draw tool, rectangle (like kicad)
		- Add right click menu to items in table of contents.
			- Add 'Rename' and 'remove' to item right click (pac, sym, dev) selection. Add 'New' to blank space right click.  
	- DRAWING: Rectangles, ability to enter height width and then origin. Would really help while drawing things from datasheets. (enhanced box.ulp)
	- INFO/PROPERTIES: Labels for coordinate boxes. X1, X2, Y1, Y2
	- ROUTE: Along with loop removal, have a stub removal. (might get tricky if you have open ends on other routes of net, maybe set the stub removal to only look to 1 or 2 joints deep.)
	- NET CLASSES: Allow clearance values to be % of width.

TIPS TO SHOW:
	- MITER: Click and drag to dynamically set radius.
	- Windows folder, hide backup file extensions (attrib +h *.L#1 /s)
	- Windows mouse axis lock using autohotkey.


EAGLE Bugs:
	- 8.1.1: Changelog mentions "With group default on, allow INFO to show automatically when an object is already selected (do not have to click info then select object)."
		This does not work for me.
	- PERFORMANCE: Large design bogs down while panning/zooming. Very jerky movement, while only ~12% CPU being used.
		CAM PERFORMANCE: Large design takes ~5 minutes, but never uses more than ~12% CPU.
	- PDF PRINTER: Vector font in PDF prints is not selectable or searchable. (proportional font is searchable, not VECTOR)
		From Help: Texts in a PDF file can be searched in a PDF viewer, as long as they are not using the vector font.
	- Save selection as Design Block does not open dialog.
	- Right clicking through bend styles does not cycle from follow-me to regular.
	- Eagle.scr change font to vector does not work on startup, but does when rerunning from scr button.
	- Follow-Me router does not go into vias centered. Messes up teardrop script.
	- Copying groups of vias changes the net. (GND -> GND1) but copying one at a time does not. Do not change net.
	- Project directories (ULP, SCR) do not include sub folders. Add option to include.
	- Main toolbar (Command Buttons) only snaps to right and left sides, nowhere else. Can change location from eaglerc.usr, so it is possible.
	- SHOW Group does not work. When group is selected in SCHEMATIC, it is highlighted in sch not brd. It should also highlight the group in BOARD.
	- FOLLOW-ME: Switching from standard bend style to Follow-Me (8 or 9) places route where mouse was hovering.
	REPORTED - FOLLOW-ME: Does not want to place very simple track. Possibly due to routing out of QFP pack next to net class with larger clearance.
	- ROUTE: Spacebar does not enable bottom layer while middle click does.
	- TOOLBARS: Enabling views of toolbars is global. Separate for editors.
	EAGLE HELP:
		- Cannot increase text size. Ctrl+/- does nothing.
		- Cannot switch to Eagle Help while other eagle dialog is open.
	8.2.0
	- SLICE: Stars with mouse up event, instead of mouse down. Click and hold doesn't start it. Doesn't stay on grid (got 31.29798125 instead of 31.3)
	- Group tool now snaps to grid. I do not want group to snap, hard to go between nets in schematic.
	- Route latches onto hidden airwires.
	- ROUTE: Automatic traces (obstacle avoid) do not get placed on grid.


	- GROUP: Last Tool Before Group No Longer Active
		-Versions affected: 8.2.1, 8.2.0, 8.1.1, 8.1.0, 8.0.2

RESOLVED
	- No way to select BRD/SCH (button) from cmd or shortcut. Works entering 'BOARD' from schematic, but not the other way.
		Yes: 'EDIT .brd' and 'EDIT .sch' works. Also Windows automatically get 'ALT+1,2,3' shortcuts created.



Settings from eaglerc.usr to investigate:

Option.ActivateItemOnSingleClick = "0"
Option.DisplayMode = "1"

Option.PadNames = "0"
Option.SignalNames = "0"
Option.SignalNamesOnPads = "0"
Option.SignalNamesOnTraces = "0"
